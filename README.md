# PicIOðŸ’«

PicIO is an AI-powered tool that extracts images from given files and provides descriptions for each corresponding image. It supports four different file formats and can handle multiple file uploads within the same format. With the power of Ollama's vision models, PicIO generates descriptive text for the images extracted from the documents.
